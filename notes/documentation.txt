# PHYSICS ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES

## Cython Documentation
- **Official Cython Guide**
  - Focus on: C++ integration, memory management, Python type annotations
  - Key sections: "Using C++ in Cython" and "Wrapping C++ Classes"

## Python C API Reference
- **Python/C API Reference Manual**
  - Essential for understanding how Python objects work at the C level

## Pygame-CE Documentation
- **Pygame Community Edition**
  - Focus on: surface manipulation, sprite management, integration points

## Physics Engine Concepts
### Rigid Body Dynamics
