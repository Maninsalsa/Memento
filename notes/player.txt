The Player class inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite, so the built-in methods would be 
__init__() and update(), since those are overridden from the parent class pygame.sprite.Sprite.

Looking at the __init__ method, it calls super().__init__(), which is the 
Sprite's initializer. 
Then it sets up debug info, loads sprites, initializes rect, animation, movement,
and shooting settings. 

The other built-in method is update(), which handles the game loop updates.

CUSTOM METHODS

The user mentioned marking built-in methods, so I'll note __init__ and update as such.
The rest are custom methods. For each method, I need to describe what they do. 
For example, _setup_debug_info initializes paths and prints debug info. _load_sprites
handles loading all the necessary sprites, with error handling.

I should categorize them into sections like Initialization, Sprite Management, Animation,

Movement, etc., to make it easier to understand. Each component's description should 
be concise but informative, explaining their role in the class.

I also need to ensure that private methods (those starting with underscores) are clearly 
noted. For instance, methods like _handle_input or _update_animation are part of the 
internal workings and not meant to be called externally.

Attributes like projectile_manager, scaled_size, rect, etc., should be listed under 
Instance Attributes, explaining their purpose and any default values.

Potential issues to watch for: making sure all methods are covered, correctly identifying 
built-ins, and accurately describing each component's functionality without missing any 
details. Also, ensuring the organization is logical so the user can follow along easily.

Finally, I'll summarize the key points and offer further clarification if needed, aligning
with the user's learning goals and the guidelines provided in the custom instructions.

Let's break down the Player class components systematically. I'll organize this by category
and mark built-in methods with [PyGame Built-In]:

**CLASS STRUCTURE**

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):  # Inherits from PyGame's Sprite class


**BUILT-IN METHODS**

def __init__(self, projectile_manager):  # [PyGame Built-In] Constructor
def update(self):  # [PyGame Built-In] Called every frame by sprite group


**INITIALIZATION METHODS**

def _setup_debug_info(self):
# Sets up file paths and prints directory info for asset loading

def _load_sprites(self):
# Main sprite loader with error handling, coordinates other loading methods

def _setup_animation(self):
# Initializes animation timers, frame counters, and starting state

def _setup_movement(self):
# Sets default movement parameters (speed, target position)

def _setup_shooting(self):
# Configures projectile firing mechanics and cooldown


**SPRITE MANAGEMENT**

def _load_base_image(self):
# Loads initial standing sprite used for instantiation

def _load_idle_animations(self):
# Loads left/right idle animation frames into separate lists

def _load_movement_animations(self):
# Loads walking animations with error checking and fallbacks

def _create_fallback_movement_sprite(self, index, path):
# Creates colored placeholder surfaces for missing sprites

def _create_fallback_sprites(self):
# Full fallback system when all asset loading fails


**ANIMATION SYSTEM**

def _update_animation(self):
# Handles frame advancement based on timer and animation type


**MOVEMENT SYSTEM**

def set_destination(self, pos):
# Public method to set new movement target from mouse input

def _handle_input(self):
# Processes right-click movement commands

def _handle_movement(self):
# Calculates pathfinding and updates position + facing direction


**COMBAT SYSTEM**

def _handle_shooting(self):
# Manages spacebar shooting with cooldown system

def set_projectile_range(self, new_range):
# Public method to modify projectile distance


**INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES**

# Core functionality
self.projectile_manager  # Reference to projectile system
self.rect  # [PyGame Built-In] Position and collision rect

# Visuals
self.image  # [PyGame Built-In] Current displayed image
self.scaled_size  # Uniform sprite dimensions (64x64)

# Animation state
self.current_animation  # Active sprite list (idle/moving)
self.facing_left  # Direction tracking bool

# Movement
self.target_pos  # Destination coordinates
self.speed = 5  # Pixels per frame movement

# Combat
self.can_shoot  # Shooting cooldown flag
self.projectile_range = 500  # Default attack range


**KEY DESIGN PATTERNS**
1. **Encapsulation**: Private methods (_prefix) handle internal systems
2. **State Management**: current_animation tracks movement/idle states
3. **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation for missing assets
4. **Frame Timing**: animation_timer ensures consistent frame rates
5. **Directional Awareness**: facing_left bool maintains orientation state
