## Development Log

### Session Progress

**Initial Rival Integration**
- Added rival import to main.py
- Created rival instance with projectile_manager
- Added rival to sprite group for rendering and updates
- Fixed asset path issues (adding sprites folder, correct subdirectories)

**Collision Detection System**
- Implemented hitbox for Rival (80% of sprite size)
- Added collision detection method in Rival class
- Maintained hitbox position to follow sprite movement
- Added debug rendering of hitboxes when enabled

**Damage Animation Flow**
1. Projectile hits rival hitbox
2. Collision triggers take_damage() method
3. Direction-aware damage animation displays
4. Animation reverts to idle after damage_duration

**Key Code Components**
- Separate animation lists for different states (idle_left, idle_right, damage_left, damage_right)
- State-based animation system with timing controls
- Fallback sprite generation for missing assets
- Hitbox-based collision rather than sprite rectangle collision

**Pending Implementation**
- Health display and actual damage calculation
- Death animation and handling
- More sophisticated rival AI behavior

# Session Development Log

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Memento
- **Type**: Pygame-based 2D game
- **Architecture**: Entity-component system with manager classes

## Code Structure
```
src/
├── assets/sprites/player/...
├── entities/
│   ├── player.py
│   ├── rival.py
│   └── projectiles.py
├── systems/
│   ├── debug.py
│   └── projectile_manager.py
└── main.py
```

## Key Components

### Player Entity
- Animated sprite with idle and movement states
- Direction-aware animations (left/right)
- Mouse-based movement system
- Projectile firing capability

### Projectile System
- Manager class for handling projectiles
- Physics-based movement
- Range-limited projectiles
- Collision detection with targets

### Debug System
- Toggle-able debug overlay
- FPS counter and position tracking
- Hitbox visualization

### Main Game Loop
- Event handling (input, window events)
- State updates for all game objects
- Rendering pipeline
- Frame rate control

## Learning Points

1. **Python Conventions**:
   - Underscore prefix (`_method_name`) for internal/private methods
   - This is a Python-specific convention, not enforced by the language

2. **Game Architecture**:
   - Separation of entities and systems
   - Manager classes for related functionality
   - Event-driven gameplay

3. **Pygame Patterns**:
   - Main game loop structure
   - Sprite management
   - Surface rendering
   - Event handling

## Development Path
- Created player entity with animation system
- Implemented movement and controls
- Added projectile system with collision
- Incorporated rival entity as target
- Added debug visualization system

## Next Steps (from Roadmap)
1. Complete Python fundamentals review
2. Deepen understanding of Pygame basics
3. Study project structure patterns
4. Master sprite and animation systems
5. Explore advanced game systems
6. Implement additional features

# Development Session Log

## Project: Memento
**Session Focus**: Code organization and unused functions analysis

## Current Project Structure
```
src/
├── entities/
│   ├── player.py
│   ├── blue.py
│   └── projectiles.py
├── systems/
│   ├── debug.py
│   └── projectile_manager.py
├── assets/
│   └── sprites/
│       ├── player/
│       └── enemies/
├── main.py
└── __init__.py
```

## Code Analysis Findings

### Unused Functions/Methods
1. **main.py**
   - `setup_logging()` - Defined but not implemented

2. **player.py**
   - `set_destination(pos)` - Awaiting scene system
   - `set_projectile_range(new_range)` - Awaiting upgrade system

3. **debug.py**
   - `setup_logging()` - Defined but not implemented

### Directory Structure Updates
- Flattened sprite directory structure
- Moved from nested directories to organized flat structure
- Updated file paths in code accordingly

### Package Organization
- Clarified purpose of `__init__.py`
- Currently minimal but prepared for future expansion
- Will be used for package-level imports and API definition

## Key Learnings

### State Management
- State flags used for tracking conditions
- Examples in Player class:
  ```python
  self.can_shoot = True  # Shooting state
  self.facing_left = True  # Direction state
  ```

### File Organization
- Sprite organization best practices
- Balance between organization and complexity
- Simplified path management

### Package Structure
- `__init__.py` importance for:
  1. Package declaration
  2. Import control
  3. Package initialization

## Future Implementation Notes

### Planned Systems
1. Scene Management
   - Will utilize `set_destination()` in player.py
   - Part of broader game state management

2. Upgrade System
   - Will implement `set_projectile_range()`
   - Player progression mechanics

3. Logging System
   - Multiple `setup_logging()` functions to be consolidated
   - Centralized logging management needed

## Next Steps
1. Implement scene management system
2. Consolidate logging functionality
3. Develop upgrade system
4. Complete background/environment system
